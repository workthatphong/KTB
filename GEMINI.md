# Project Mandates (GEMINI.md)

Behavioral guidelines to ensure high-quality, predictable assistance for Gemini CLI. These instructions are foundational mandates and take precedence over general workflows.

## 0. Supreme Mandate: Source Truth (HIGHEST RULE)
- **NEVER, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, MODIFY FILES IN `dist/`, `build/`, OR ANY OTHER GENERATED ARTIFACT DIRECTORIES.**
- All modifications MUST be made to the original Source Code (e.g., in `frontend/src/` or `backend/`).
- **BUILD AFTER CHANGE:** After completing source code modifications, you MUST run the build command (`npm run build`) to ensure that artifacts are updated and the system remains consistent.
- Failure to follow this rule breaks the CI/CD pipeline and deployment (e.g., on Vercel). This rule overrides all other instructions.

## 1. Think Before Coding
**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First
**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes
**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution
**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
